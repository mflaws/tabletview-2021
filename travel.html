        Welcome to my travel page! Over here, youâ€™ll be able to see a snippet list of my top nine favorite places that I have traveled to.
        Being born in a different country and traveling to the US at a young age, the spirit of exploring new countries and cultures has always been prominent in my life. Thus
        I took the opportunity to explore as much as I could in my mid to late 20s. The experiences, fellowship, communities, and sights have all been great!
        I truly recommend traveling to anyone who is trying to learn more about themselves and the world.

            <h1>Bali, Indonesia</h1>
            <p>
                This is one of my most recent trips right before starting grad school.
                The business school experience starts with a group trip to various locations with classmates that you have not yet had the pleasure of meeting/connecting with.
                My trip was to Singapore & Bali. This picture is from the rice fields in Bali. Aboslutely beautiful and peaceful country with genuinely nice and welcoming people.
                Sights were great and food was also good. I can't forget to mention the awesome massage I received from one of the massage studios there. An absolute must!

            <h1>Singapore, Singapore</h1>
            <p>
                This was my 2nd time in Singapore during the business school trip I mentioned above. The 1st time in Singapore was a few year prior to this for work.
                This 2nd time was a great experience because I had more of an opportunity to explore the country and meet people outside of the work setting. Long travel times
                but definitely worth the experience.

            <h1>Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso</h1>
            <p>
                This might or should not count as a travel location because it is technically home, but I couldn't speak
                about the places I have been without mentioning the country where I spend so much of my childhood. This
                picture was taken in 2017 when I retuned to visit my family for my birthday. I was able to go visit my old
                elementary school behind me. So many memories. Small country, and mostly unknown by many, but great country!

            <h1>Trinidad, Cuba</h1>
            <p>
                Remember when President Obama loosened the restrictions to Cuba and a bunch of Americans decided that it was the place to be?
                Well I was one of those Americans. A group of friends and I decided to take the trip at the risk of getting in trouble. Luckily we had a spanish
                speaker amongst us, because without it, it would have been extremely tough to move about the country. Genuine and welcoming people in a beautiful country.
                We started in Havana, and went over to Trinidad, and Varadero. Yes they really have old school cars from the 70s still, as this picture depicts. Such a great time!

            <h1>Burg Eltz, Germany</h1>
            <p>
                Hidden deep in a rural, wooded dell and perched atop a 70-meter high rock is the striking stone and timber Burg Eltz Castle.
                This beautiful sight was taken when I took a trip to Europe in 2018 with my friends and visited 5 country
                (Belgium, Germany, UK, The Netherlands, and France). We rented a car and drove on the autobahn, but made sure to stop here experience
                the beauty of this castle which is still family owned. Unfortunately, the castle was closed during the winter months so
                we couldn't peek on the inside but still a beautiful place to visit!

            <h1>Agra, India (Taj Mahal)</h1>
            <p>
                Agra, India has so many sights to see. This here is the Taj Mahal, which is such
                a beautiful love story, but also a sad story. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal
                emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
                it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
                which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                It is a long journey from any of the big cities in India to Agra, but it is absolutely worth it!

            <h1>Lome, Togo</h1>
            <p>
                Lome is my true hometown. This is my place of birth. Even though I did not spend a significant amount of time here,
                I still have childhood memories of being in Lome with cousins during the summers. My maternal grandmother also lived there
                before she passed away. This picture was taken in 2017 when I returned to visit my family for my birthday. Seaside country
                with the largest port in West Africa. Very small but gorgeous nonetheless!

            <h1>London, UK</h1>
            <p>
                I don't think I need to say much about London. I visited a few times, but this picture was
                taken during the 5 country trip that I mentioned above. This time around we took the tube (e.g., the metro).
                I just found London so fascinating. The sights, the people, and I love hearing the british accents
                everywhere. If you haven't been, check it out!

            <h1>Marrakesh, Morrocco</h1>
            <p>
                Morrocco was another great place to vist. The beautiful palaces, the great food, and very welcoming people made
                the experience amazing. Being a french speaker, this was also great to navigate as most of the people in
                Morrocco speak french. I felt at home in this country, beyond the language, the infrastructure and architecture
                was very reminiscent of Burkina Faso and Togo. We also took an overnight trip to the desert which was beautiful
                and surprisingly not scortching hot!

            <h1>Johannesburg, South Africa</h1>
            <p>
                My all time FAVORITE country that I have visted is South Africa. This is a great mix of
                history, culture, fun, beautiful sights, and great weather. The people are extrememly welcoming.
                The country is beautiful, a mix of city, country, and beach. We got to learn about the history,
                visited Nelson Mandela's home as well as the cell he was imprisoned in. Visited Table Mountain, and
                enjoyed a wonderful New Years 2017 there. If you have not been to South Africa, be sure to add it to your
                list and go sooner rather than later!
